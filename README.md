# E-commerce-Back-End-SMM

This project is a homework assignment for Rutgers Coding Bootcamp.

## Description
The user can add their database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file. They are able to connect to a database using Sequelize
and when they enter schema and seed commands, a development database is created and is seeded with test data. 
When the user enters the command to invoke the application, the server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database. The user is able to open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags to test. The data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON, and when the user tests the API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, then they are able to successfully create, update, and delete data in their database.
